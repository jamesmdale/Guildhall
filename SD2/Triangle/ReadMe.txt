How to Use:

When Asteroids begins. Six large asteroids spawn and begin rotating and moving in random directions. A ship spawns in the center of the screen
oriented to be facing upwards.  Use your ship to shoot asteroids to destroy them. When an asteroid is destroyed, if it is of a large or medium size, asteroids of one
smaller spawn. When all the asteroids on the screen are destroyed, a new wave of asteroids spawns with more asteroids than the last. If a player collides with an asteroids,
the player is destroyed.

The following keys will have the listed actions:

Pressing the 'I' key spawns a new asteroid.
Pressing the 'O' key destroys an asteroid.
Pressing the 'N' key or 'START' button on a connected XBOX controller will reset the ship to the center of the screen.
Pressing and holding the 'T' key slows down time to 1/10th of normal speed.
Pressing the P key will pause the game. Pressing the P key again will unpause the game.
Pressing the 'Escape' key will exit the game.
Pressing W or the UP ARROW will accelerate the ship
Pressing A or LEFT ARROW will rotate the ship left.  Pressing the D or the RIGHT ARROW will rotate the ship right.
Pressing Space or 'A' on a connected XBOX controller will shoot a bullet at the nose of the ship forward.

Manipulating the LEFT ANALOG stick on a connected XBOX controller will also move the ship in the direction of the analog.


Deep Learning:

For this assignment, my time management was lacking.  I initially got the math working, and the new requirements surrounding the asteroids very quickly.
This inspired a false sense of security in terms of my ability to quickly finish the movement. I also suffered from not refactoring my names after the first assignment.
I spent a considerable amount of time between coding sessions trying to recollect what variables in relation to my ship's movement meant by their name.  My objective for
project 3 is to do some refactoring before I begin on the work.  I also am going to begin working every night immediately after class to address the topics discussed
in class while they are still fresh on my mind.  

I feel like AT LEAST starting on the portion of the project we discussed in each class will -

1. Help keep me working throughout the week regardless of my perceived comfort level with getting the project done on time.
2. Increase the quality of my code and the speed at which I can solve problems because my mindset will still very much be geared towards SD1 class as opposed
to one of my other classes.
3. Give myself more opportunity to ask meaningful questions in the following class in regards to the previous work described.

I feel like being more proactive in my work in this class as early as possible will do wonders for increasing my productivity.
